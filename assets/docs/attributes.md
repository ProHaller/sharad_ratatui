# Attributes

In _Shadowrun_, attributes define a character’s core capabilities, shaping how they interact with the Sixth World’s physical, mental, and metaphysical challenges. Below is a brief description of each attribute, based on the standard rules (e.g., _Shadowrun 5th Edition_ or _6th Edition_):

- **BODY**

  - Measures physical durability and toughness. Determines how much damage you can take (hit points, essentially) and resist toxins, diseases, or exhaustion. High BODY suits tanks or anyone expecting to get shot at.

- **AGILITY**

  - Governs dexterity, coordination, and finesse. Key for shooting guns, sneaking, picking locks, or dodging. A must for street samurai, infiltrators, or anyone relying on precise movement.

- **REACTION**

  - Reflects reflexes and quickness. Affects initiative (how fast you act in combat) and dodging attacks. Pairs with INTUITION for surprise checks. Great for drivers, gunners, or anyone needing split-second timing.

- **STRENGTH**

  - Raw physical power. Controls melee damage, lifting capacity, and climbing or jumping ability. Essential for close-combat brawlers or anyone swinging a katana or fist.

- **WILLPOWER**

  - Mental resilience and determination. Resists magic (like spell damage), fear, and mental strain. Also fuels spellcasting stamina for mages. High WILLPOWER keeps you sane in the shadows.

- **LOGIC**

  - Intelligence and analytical ability. Drives hacking, technical skills (like fixing drones), and knowledge checks. Deckers, riggers, and brainy types thrive with high LOGIC.

- **INTUITION**

  - Gut instinct and perception. Covers noticing details, avoiding ambushes (with REACTION), and street smarts. Useful for shamans, investigators, or anyone navigating the sprawl’s chaos.

- **CHARISMA**

  - Charm, social savvy, and presence. Powers negotiation, intimidation, and conning. Critical for faces (social specialists) and some mages (spirit summoning). Elves love this one.

- **EDGE**

  - Luck and grit. A meta-attribute letting you reroll dice, cheat death, or seize the moment. It’s your “get out of jail free” card—rare and precious. Higher EDGE means more clutch plays.

- **MAGIC**

  - Mystical power for awakened characters (mages, shamans, adepts). Determines spellcasting strength, spirit control, or physical adept abilities. Zero for mundanes; high for magical heavyweights.

- **RESONANCE**
  - Technomancer mojo. The Matrix equivalent of MAGIC, it fuels living code manipulation, sprite summoning, and resisting dumpshock. Only technomancers have it; mundanes and mages don’t.

These attributes split into **Physical** (BODY, AGILITY, REACTION, STRENGTH), **Mental** (WILLPOWER, LOGIC, INTUITION, CHARISMA), and **Special** (EDGE, MAGIC, RESONANCE) categories. They’re rated numerically (e.g., 1-6 for humans in 5th Edition, higher with metatypes or augmentation), and you roll dice based on them plus skills to succeed at tasks.
