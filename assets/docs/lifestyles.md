# Lifestyles in Shadowrun

In the _Shadowrun_ role-playing game, lifestyles represent the standard of living a character maintains, reflecting their income, social status, and day-to-day existence in the gritty, cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of the Sixth World. Lifestyles are a key mechanic in the game, affecting not just flavor but also gameplay elements like healing, contacts, and how much attention a character might draw from others (e.g., corps, gangs, or authorities). The core rulebooks, such as _Shadowrun 5th Edition_ or _Shadowrun 6th Edition (Sixth World)_, outline a range of lifestyles, typically categorized by cost in nuyen (the game’s currency) and tied to specific perks or drawbacks. Below are the common lifestyles, based on the standard framework from the game:

## 1. **Street**

- **Cost:** Free (or negligible)
- **Description:** You’re living on the edge—homeless, squatting in abandoned buildings, or crashing in the urban sprawl’s underbelly. Think alleyways, derelict squats, or makeshift shelters in the Barrens. No amenities, no security, and constant exposure to danger (weather, gangers, or worse).
- **Gameplay Impact:** No rent, but healing takes longer due to poor conditions, and you’re vulnerable to random events like theft or shakedowns.

## 2. **Squatter**

- **Cost:** Very low (e.g., 500 nuyen/month in 5th Edition)
- **Description:** A step up from Street, this is bare-bones living—think condemned apartments, shantytowns, or a coffin motel. You’ve got a roof, maybe sporadic electricity, and a shared bathroom if you’re lucky.
- **Gameplay Impact:** Cheap, but still rough. Limited access to comforts, and neighbors might be nosy or dangerous.

## 3. **Low**

- **Cost:** Moderate (e.g., 2,000 nuyen/month)
- **Description:** The working-class lifestyle—small apartments, cramped condos, or a room in a boarding house. Basic utilities, some security (like a lock that actually works), and maybe a soycaf maker. Common for wageslaves or low-tier runners.
- **Gameplay Impact:** Affordable and functional, with decent recovery conditions. Nothing flashy, though.

## 4. **Middle**

- **Cost:** Higher (e.g., 5,000 nuyen/month)
- **Description:** Comfortable living—a suburban house, a nice apartment, or a condo with real food in the fridge (not just soy). You’ve got reliable Matrix access, good security, and maybe a garage for your bike or car. This is typical for successful shadowrunners or mid-level corp employees.
- **Gameplay Impact:** Balances cost and benefits. Good for laying low or impressing small-time contacts.

## 5. **High**

- **Cost:** Expensive (e.g., 10,000 nuyen/month)
- **Description:** Luxury starts here—spacious lofts, gated communities, or penthouses with drones for housekeeping. High-end security, real leather furniture, and maybe a view of the Seattle skyline. Suits elite runners, fixers, or minor corp execs.
- **Gameplay Impact:** Costs a lot but offers perks like faster recovery, better contacts, and a safer bolthole. Draws more attention, though.

## 6. **Luxury**

- **Cost:** Extravagant (e.g., 100,000 nuyen/month or more)
- **Description:** The top tier—mansions, private islands, or arcology suites. Armed guards, cutting-edge tech, and every indulgence imaginable (think hot tubs with imported water). This is for megacorp bigwigs, dragons, or runners who’ve hit the jackpot.
- **Gameplay Impact:** Insane upkeep, but you’re untouchable (until someone decides to crash your party). Great for status, terrible for staying off the radar.

### Additional Notes

- **Custom Lifestyles:** Some editions (like 5th Edition’s _Run Faster_) let you tweak lifestyles with qualities (e.g., “Safehouse” for extra security or “Obscure” to avoid notice). You can mix and match costs and features.
- **Temporary Lifestyles:** Runners often buy lifestyles for a month at a time, reflecting their transient, job-to-job existence.
- **Group Lifestyles:** Teams might pool nuyen to share a base, splitting costs and risks.
- **Setting Flavor:** Lifestyles vary by sprawl—Seattle’s Redmond Barrens might cap you at Squatter unless you’re a gang lord, while Downtown’s High lifestyles gleam with corporate polish.
