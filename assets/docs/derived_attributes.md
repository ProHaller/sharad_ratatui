# Derived Attributes

## - **Initiative**

- Determines turn order in combat. Calculated as REACTION + INTUITION + 1d6 (or more dice with boosts like Wired Reflexes). Higher totals act first; each round, you subtract 10 and go again until it’s zero or negative. Augments, spells, or drugs can juice this up.

## - **Limits: PHY / MEN / SOC**

- Caps on how many successes (hits) you can keep from a dice roll, reflecting natural boundaries.
  - **Physical (PHY):** Based on (STR × 2 + BOD + REA) ÷ 3. Limits tests like athletics or combat.
  - **Mental (MEN):** Based on (LOG × 2 + INT + WIL) ÷ 3. Limits hacking, perception, or memory.
  - **Social (SOC):** Based on (CHA × 2 + WIL + ESS) ÷ 3. Limits conning or negotiation.
- Gear, magic, or qualities can tweak these. (_6th Edition_ simplifies this into a single “Edge” mechanic, dropping Limits.)

## - **Monitors: PHY/SOC**

- Tracks damage a character can take before dropping.
  - **Physical Condition Monitor (PHY):** Hit points, essentially. Calculated as (BODY ÷ 2, rounded up) + 8. Boxes fill with physical damage (bullets, fists); overflow means you’re out or dying.
  - **Stun Condition Monitor (SOC):** Mental/physical fatigue. Calculated as (WILLPOWER ÷ 2, rounded up) + 8. Fills with stun damage (tasers, spells); full means unconsciousness.
- (_6th Edition_ renames SOC to “Stun” but keeps the idea.)

## - **Essence**

- A measure of your “humanity” or soul, starting at 6 for most metahumans. Cyberware and bioware implants reduce it—lose too much (to 0 or below), and you die or become a cyberzombie. Affects MAGIC/RESONANCE (lower Essence weakens them) and Social Limit. It’s the cost of chrome.

## - **Edge Points**

- Your pool of luck, tied to the EDGE attribute. Spend a point to reroll failures, boost a roll, act first, or escape death. Refreshes each session or run (GM’s call). In _6th Edition_, Edge is more dynamic, gained/spent fluidly in combat, capped by your EDGE stat.

## - **Armor**

- Protection against damage. Rated numerically (e.g., Armor Jacket is 12). Added to BODY when soaking damage—roll that total, and each hit reduces incoming damage. Can be penetrated by AP (Armor Penetration) from weapons. Stacks with cyberware or magic, but encumbrance might slow you down if too heavy.
