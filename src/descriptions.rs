pub const LIFESTYLE: &str = r#"
Lifestyles represent the standard of living a character maintains, reflecting their income, social status, and day-to-day existence in the gritty, cyberpunk-meets-fantasy world of the Sixth World. Lifestyles are a key mechanic in the game, affecting not just flavor but also gameplay elements like healing, contacts, and how much attention a character might draw from others (e.g., corps, gangs, or authorities).

// region:  --- Attributes
pub const BODY: &str = r#"
Measures physical durability and toughness. Determines how much damage you can take (hit points, essentially) and resist toxins, diseases, or exhaustion. High BODY suits tanks or anyone expecting to get shot at.
"#;

pub const AGILITY: &str = r#"
Governs dexterity, coordination, and finesse. Key for shooting guns, sneaking, picking locks, or dodging. A must for street samurai, infiltrators, or anyone relying on precise movement.
"#;

pub const REACTION: &str = r#"
Reflects reflexes and quickness. Affects initiative (how fast you act in combat) and dodging attacks. Pairs with INTUITION for surprise checks. Great for drivers, gunners, or anyone needing split-second timing.
"#;

pub const STRENGTH: &str = r#"
Raw physical power. Controls melee damage, lifting capacity, and climbing or jumping ability. Essential for close-combat brawlers or anyone swinging a katana or fist.
"#;

pub const WILLPOWER: &str = r#"
Mental resilience and determination. Resists magic (like spell damage), fear, and mental strain. Also fuels spellcasting stamina for mages. High WILLPOWER keeps you sane in the shadows.
"#;

pub const LOGIC: &str = r#"
Intelligence and analytical ability. Drives hacking, technical skills (like fixing drones), and knowledge checks. Deckers, riggers, and brainy types thrive with high LOGIC.
"#;

pub const INTUITION: &str = r#"
Gut instinct and perception. Covers noticing details, avoiding ambushes (with REACTION), and street smarts. Useful for shamans, investigators, or anyone navigating the sprawl’s chaos.
"#;

pub const CHARISMA: &str = r#"
Charm, social savvy, and presence. Powers negotiation, intimidation, and conning. Critical for faces (social specialists) and some mages (spirit summoning). Elves love this one.
"#;

pub const EDGE: &str = r#"
Luck and grit. A meta-attribute letting you reroll dice, cheat death, or seize the moment. It’s your “get out of jail free” card—rare and precious. Higher EDGE means more clutch plays.
"#;

pub const MAGIC: &str = r#"
Mystical power for awakened characters (mages, shamans, adepts). Determines spellcasting strength, spirit control, or physical adept abilities. Zero for mundanes; high for magical heavyweights.
"#;

pub const RESONANCE: &str = r#"
Technomancer mojo. The Matrix equivalent of MAGIC, it fuels living code manipulation, sprite summoning, and resisting dumpshock. Only technomancers have it; mundanes and mages don’t.
"#;

pub const INITIATIVE: &str = r#"
The Initiative attribute is a combination of the AGILITY and REACTION attributes. It determines how quickly a character can act in combat, and is often used to determine who goes first in a fight.
