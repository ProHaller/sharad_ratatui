In Shadowrun, ties are broken in favor of the character with the higher relevant attribute. Therefore, 'Crusher' Johnson wins this round of the strong arm contest, but only by a narrow margin.",
    "fluff": "The crowded bar falls into a hushed silence as Jake 'Iron Grip' Martinez and the mountain of augmented muscle known as 'Crusher' Johnson take their positions at the sturdy durasteel table. The air is thick with the smell of spilled synth-ale and the acrid tang of anticipation. Jake's cybernetically enhanced arms glisten under the flickering neon lights, a testament to the melding of man and machine. Across from him, Crusher's massive form seems to dwarf the table, his arms rippling with a combination of vat-grown muscle and cutting-edge myomer fibers. As the referee - a grizzled ork with a chest full of milspec chrome - gives the signal, both contestants lock hands. The veins in Jake's neck bulge as he strains against Crusher's immovable grip. For a moment, it seems like the universe itself is holding its breath. Muscles quiver and servos whine as the two titans of strength push against each other with everything they've got. The durasteel table groans under the pressure, and for a split second, it looks like Jake might just pull off a miracle. But then, with a primal roar that sends nearby glasses rattling, Crusher surges forward. It's not a decisive victory - more like the inevitable grinding of tectonic plates - but it's enough. Jake's arm slowly, inexorably, begins to tilt backward. The crowd erupts into a cacophony of cheers and groans as cred-sticks change hands. Jake slumps back, sweat glistening on his brow, while Crusher raises his arms in triumph. It was close - closer than anyone expected - but in the brutal world of the shadows, close doesn't cut it. At least, not today."
